## Pickup Props  
Ensure that a box, sphere or capsule collider (appropriately sized) exist on the same object as the 'CVR Pickup Object' component, or pick up will be difficult if not impossible.  
Note: the collider does not have to be set to impact with players, you can use the 'Is Trigger' option too.
